\chapter{Results \& Evaluation}

\section{Experiment Results}
% Talk about how each experiment went?
% Talk about the experiments as a whole
% e.g. the graphs and what you would have learnt
% and what you would have changed for next time

The experimental phase finished over the course of roughly 8 weeks, including the creation of the code, running the experiments and redoing failed rounds. The evaluation of the experiments will be based on the hypothesis made in the Design chapter of the report. This section included how a papers reported different outcomes with different growing environments and how these can be applied to this project.

The hypothesis in question was based on red light producing plants with highest leaf and total dry weight. The other differences in growth were related to the chemical compounds produced, as there was not sufficient equipment provided to explore this further. Instead, measurements were made on the length of the different parts of the cress which correlates to the weight.

The \textcolor{blue}{$.csv$} file generated by the CLUE board in the greenhouse was used to ensure that the environment had stable conditions throughout the six day period.
